# Comunio Enhancer

It adds several additions to the site, e.g. QuickLinks to Comstats and ComAnalytics. It also calculates the current win-margin for players on the exchangemarket.

## Installation
Use [this link](https://github.com/traschke/comunio-enhacer-userscript/raw/master/ComunioEnhancer.user.js) to install the UserScript. If the correct browser extension is installed, it should guide you through the rest of the process.
